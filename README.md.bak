**From pip**

```

```
****
[Optional]
```
~/$ touch $HOME/.cn/cn.conf
~/$ nano $HOME/.cn/cn.conf 
```
The configuration file should look like this :
```
#-------------------------------------
# cn configuration file exemple
# Uncomment the following lines

#[cyphernode_config]
#cnid = "cyphernode_id"
#key = "cyphernode_key"
#url = "cyphernode_url:2009/v0"
```
****
**From sources**

Clone libcn :
```
~/$ git clone https://github.com/tomtibo/libcn/
```
****
By default, libcn will look for a config file at $HOME/.cn/cn.conf. Optionaly you can specify the config file location with configfile argument OR using cnid, key and url arguments directly. 

[Optional]
```
~/$ cd libcn

~/libcn/$ mv cn.conf.exemple $HOME/.cn/cn.conf

~/libcn/$ nano $HOME/.cn/cn.conf 
```
The configuration file should look like this :
```
#-------------------------------------
# libcn configuration file exemple
# Uncomment the following lines

#[cyphernode_config]
#cnid = "cyphernode_id"
#key = "cyphernode_key"
#url = "cyphernode_url:2009/v0"
```

**Things that do not work**

For now, libcn is a client library only, so it can not be used to handle callbacks.

Command not working:
- hello_world
- watchtxid
- gettxnslist
- conf
- newblock
- executecallbacks
- ots_backoffice
- maybe more ....

**To do**

- Add more security for storing the configuration file data.
- Fix not working things
- Handle security level based on cyphernode id
- Make request more low level. Use socket not requests lib.
- Add server mode for callbacks
- Add cypher mode for running code as a cypherapps
